# üöÄ GitHub Publishing Guide

## Steps to Publish Your Fake Review Detection Project

### 1. Prepare Your Repository

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd "C:\Deep\ACTUAL PROJECT"

# Initialize git repository (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Advanced Fake Review Detection System

- Multi-LLM labeling with Groq Llama 3.3-70B
- Enhanced BART fine-tuning achieving 83% accuracy
- Comprehensive evaluation and comparison system
- Production-ready classification pipeline"
```

### 2. Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and sign in
2. **Click "New repository"** (green button)
3. **Repository name**: `fake-review-detection` or `advanced-review-classifier`
4. **Description**: "Advanced Fake Review Detection System using BART and Multi-LLM Labeling - 83% Accuracy"
5. **Visibility**: Public (recommended for portfolio) or Private
6. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (you already have these)
7. **Click "Create repository"**

### 3. Connect Local Repository to GitHub

```bash
# Add GitHub remote (replace USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/fake-review-detection.git

# Set main branch
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### 4. Important: Handle Large Files and Sensitive Data

Before pushing, make sure to:

#### A. Remove/Ignore Large Files
```bash
# Check file sizes
find . -type f -size +50M

# If you have large model files, consider using Git LFS
git lfs track "*.bin"
git lfs track "*.safetensors"
git add .gitattributes
```

#### B. Remove API Keys
```bash
# Make sure no API keys are in your code
grep -r "sk-" . || echo "No API keys found"
grep -r "gsk_" . || echo "No Groq keys found"

# If found, remove them and use environment variables instead
```

#### C. Sample Data Only
```bash
# Create a small sample dataset for demonstration
head -n 100 google_reviews_labeled_combined_with_json.csv > data/sample_reviews.csv
```

### 5. Create an Impressive Repository Description

When you push, update your GitHub repository with:

**About Section:**
- Description: "üõ°Ô∏è Advanced ML system for fake review detection using BART + Multi-LLM labeling. Achieves 83% accuracy on Google Reviews classification."
- Website: (your portfolio/demo link if you have one)
- Topics: `machine-learning`, `nlp`, `fake-detection`, `bart`, `transformers`, `review-analysis`, `python`, `pytorch`

### 6. Add Repository Badges

Add these to the top of your README.md:

```markdown
[![Python 3.8+](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.8+-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)
[![Accuracy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Accuracy-83%25-green.svg)]()
[![Model](https://img.shields.io/badge/Model-BART-orange.svg)](https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-large-mnli)
```

### 7. Create Releases

After your first push:

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click "Releases" ‚Üí "Create a new release"
3. Tag: `v1.0.0`
4. Title: `üéâ Initial Release - Advanced Fake Review Detection System`
5. Description:
```markdown

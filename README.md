# 🛡️ Review Quality Detection System

A sophisticated machine learning pipeline for detecting review quality using advanced NLP and anomaly detection## ⚠️ Limitations

### Language Support
- **English Onl## 📊 Performance Metrics

- **Training Accuracy**: 93.0%
- **Validation Accuracy**: 93.0%
- **Cross-Validation**: 93.6% ± 4.7%
- **Feature Importance**: p_bad_enhanced_interaction (37.4%)
- **Genuine Detection**: 70% success rate (with optimized thresholds)e system is currently trained and optimized for English reviews only
- **Non-English Content**: Reviews in other languages (Chinese, Malay, Tamil, etc.) may not be accurately classified
- **Mixed Language**: Reviews containing multiple languages may produce unreliable results

### Geographic Context
- **Singapore-Specific Training**: The training data was primarily scraped from Singapore-based businesses and platforms
- **Local Context Advantage**: The model performs better on reviews with Singapore/Southeast Asian context, terminology, and cultural references
- **Global Applicability**: Performance may vary when applied to reviews from other regions due to different:
  - Cultural expressions and review patterns
  - Local business practices and expectations
  - Regional slang and terminology
  - Different spam/fake review tactics

### Recommendations
- **Regional Adaptation**: For optimal performance in other regions, consider retraining with local data
- **Language Extension**: Additional training required for non-English language support
- **Cultural Calibration**: Model thresholds may need adjustment for different cultural contexts
